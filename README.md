##What is the problem?##

StarCraft2 is a Military Sci-fi Real Time Strategy with 3 races that all have different units. An aspect of the game is choosing what units to use in your army. The player has to make decisions about what units to use in their army based on information they know about their enemies army, resources they have available and what units they have available to them. This is often left to instinct of the player because their is so many variables to keep track of. Our program will give some numerical evidence behind army composition decisions.

Our project will have a config file of stats of units in the game. The user will be able to input a unit, number of that unit, a race and an amount of resources. The unit entered is the enemies unit and how many of that unit there is. The race is your race, so it limits the units you can use in this scenario. The amount of resources is how many resources you have available to defeat the enemies army. The program will then calculate, based off the inputs in the config file, what units (and how many of those units) will be needed to defeat the enemies army. The Program will take into account the amount of resources needed to win the battle scenario and use it as a measuring tool to see what is the best unit to use in the given scenario.

The program will need to take into account many different stats for each unit; HP, Armour, Shield, Attributes, Ground Damage per Second(DPS), Air DPS, Bonus damage modifiers, and Attack Cooldown. There is other aspects of the game that our program won't take into account, such as splash damage, and unit collision limiting the damage done by melee units.


##What is the something extra?##

The editable config file will make our program go the extra step. Not only will the program help players playing the original game, but it will also allow for customizable scenarios to be made, where the user can modifiy units. This could be useful for balancing the game around changes to specific units. The program will also be doing a complicated optimization around many different variables. 

##What did we learn from doing this?##
